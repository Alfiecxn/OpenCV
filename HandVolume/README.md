# Hand-Volume-Control
In this project I have built an OpenCV application in which a user can control his system's (laptop/pc) volume by making
some Hand Gestures.<br>

### Introduction :
This project is a use case of Hand Tracking technology. <br>
As soon as the user shows up his hand in the camera the application detects it & draws a bounding box around the hand.


### Main Libs Used :
- OpenCV lib(for image processing and drawing)
- Mediapipe lib(for Hand Tracking)
- Pycaw lib(to link up with the system's volume)
